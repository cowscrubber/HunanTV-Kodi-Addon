# Hunan TV Kodi Addon

This addon streams the Chinese TV network Hunan TV. This scrapes the streaming URL from the MGTV website.
Included in this addon are the following channels:
- Hunan International
- Hunan Entertainment
- Hunan Vision
- Golden Eagle Documentary

I hoped this will work with PseudoTV Live, but the video links still expire after a day. I'm hoping to fix this.

The stream used in this addon is accessible for free in http://www.mgtv.com/live. 100% legal as far as I can tell.

This is only tested to work on Kodi 18.2 Leia. I do not know if this will work in other versions as of this writing.
I am in no way warranting the reliability of this addon.
