# Hunan TV Kodi Addon

Hunan TV (Chinese TV) live streaming addon. This scrapes the streaming URL from the MGTV website.
Included in this addon are the following channels:
- Hunan International
- Hunan Entertainment
- Hunan Vision
- Golden Eagle Documentary

This is only tested to work on Kodi 18.1 Leia.
I am in no way warranting the reliability of this addon.

This is based on "Simple example plugin for Kodi mediacenter" by Romanvm.

PS. I hoped this would work with PseudoTV Live, but it doesn't. If anyone can tell me how to fix this, I'll be very grateful.
